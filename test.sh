#!/bin/bash

# It used to be that you could test a Python module which called
# testable.register() simply by running it as a script. However, the Powers
# that Be have decreed that running scripts within packages is a big fail
# (IMO, this is shortsighted, as the complexity of this script demonstrates).
# Supposedly, there's a package called runpy which does the right magic, but I
# couldn't get it to work properly.
#
# See:
#
#   http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/
#   http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0366/
#   http://bugs.python.org/issue1510172
#
# Anyway, the usage of this script is as follows:
#
#   * If you pass the filename of a module, it will be tested.
#
#   * Otherwise, this script will find all candidate modules under lib/, all
#     scripts under bin/ and test them. Modules can declare that they should
#     not be included in these automatic tests but remain testable manually;
#     if you pass -a, then these are included anyway.
#
#   * If you pass -i as the first argument, then the function
#     test_interactive() will be called instead of the non-interactive test
#     harness. This is good for drawing pictures and whatnot that need human
#     interpretation to determine correctness.
#
#   * If a script has import problems, a complaint about that will be printed
#     instead of running the tests (which obviously can't be done).
#
# BUGS:
#
#   * Fails on filenames with spaces or other funny characters.
