'''This module offers a simple interface to the TSV files we want to store.

   You will note that it doesn't use the csv module. This is because that
   module has a number of annoying habits, the most significant one being that
   it completely does not support unicode. (There are wrappers which solve
   this, but I'd prefer to keep dependencies, particularly those that don't
   come with the OS, to a minimum.) However, the final straw was the fact that
   it wanted to escape quote characters even though I specified no quoting.

   It's really a very simple format. We'll be OK.

   WARNING: Keep the TSV dialect consistent with README.

   See http://docs.python.org/library/io.html for the meaning of the buffering
   parameter. '''
