'''This module lets you do two things:

     1. Write doctest tests for your module and put them out of the way at the
        end, with no weird syntax to remember.

     2. Automatically run the tests when the module is executed.

   The way this is done is by calling register(), which invokes some very
   sneaky magic to insert the proper variables into the calling (i.e., your)
   module's namespace and then run the doctests. For example, you might put
   the following at the end of your module `foo.py` (leading comment
   characters are included to avoid making it into a real live doctest):

     # testable.register("""
     #   >>> 'hello world'
     #   'hello world'
     # """)

   Then, you can run `python foo.py` to run the tests (no output means all
   tests passed), or pass -v to see a more detailed report.

   These classes also provide a way for scripts to accept a --unittest flag.
   There are two ways to invoke the tests:

   1. (Preferred.) If the script wraps everything in a main() function, then
      the standard script idiom should be extended to:

        if (__name__ == '__main__' and not testable.do_script_tests()):
           main()

   2. (Deprecated.) If the script runs code outside main, it must parse
      --unittest itself and raise Unittests_Only_Exception (u.parse_args()
      does this), then catch the exception and skip its normal processing.

   The basic complication is that in order to put tests at the bottom of the
   script, you have to execute all the way down to the bottom of the script,
   so you can't do something analagous to argparse._HelpAction (do your thing
   and then exit immediately).'''
